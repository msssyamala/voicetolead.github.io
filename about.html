      <h1 class="section-title">Our Mission</h1>
      <p>VoiceToLead exists to empower young people with the confidence, communication skills, and leadership mindset needed to thrive in school, careers, and civic life. We design workshops, mentoring pathways, and speaking opportunities for students — especially those new to public speaking.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
      <p>Founded as a student-led initiative, VoiceToLead recognized that many students have ideas but lack safe, guided spaces to practice speaking. Partnering with experienced student mentors and supported by The Hack Foundation’s fiscal sponsorship, we deliver low-cost, high-impact programming.</p>
